Domain-Based Clustering Analysis
=====================================

Found 4 domain clusters:

üè∑Ô∏è  **User Data Management** (user-data-management)
   Domain: user-management
   Description: Handles all operations related to user data persistence and retrieval, representing the data access layer for user entities.
   Nodes: 3 functions/methods
   Reasoning: These methods are all part of the `UserRepository` class in `data.ts`, indicating a clear functional cohesion around managing user data. They represent a distinct architectural layer (data access) and a specific business domain (user management).

üè∑Ô∏è  **Core Calculation Logic** (core-calculation-logic)
   Domain: mathematical-operations
   Description: Encapsulates the primary mathematical operations that form a core business capability of the application.
   Nodes: 2 functions/methods
   Reasoning: These methods belong to the `Calculator` class and perform the fundamental arithmetic functions. The call graph shows `main` directly interacts with these methods, highlighting their role as core business logic.

üè∑Ô∏è  **Application Orchestration** (application-orchestration)
   Domain: application-lifecycle
   Description: Manages the application's startup, setup, and high-level flow, coordinating calls to core functionalities.
   Nodes: 2 functions/methods
   Reasoning: `main` serves as the application's entry point, and `createCalculator` is a factory function used by `main` to instantiate and prepare the `Calculator` for use. These functions are responsible for the overall flow and initialization, acting as an orchestration layer that ties together different components.

üè∑Ô∏è  **Common Utilities** (common-utilities)
   Domain: shared-services
   Description: Provides general-purpose helper functions and services that are not tied to a specific business domain but serve as foundational support across the application.
   Nodes: 3 functions/methods
   Reasoning: These functions are generic utilities (number formatting, parity checking, logging) found in `utils.ts`. They are typically reusable components that provide common services rather than belonging to a specific business domain or feature boundary.

Overall Reasoning:
The clustering approach focuses on identifying functional cohesion, architectural layers, and distinct business domains based on the node names, their file paths, and the provided call graph edges. Even with a limited call graph, the naming conventions (e.g., `UserRepository`, `Calculator`, `utils.ts`) strongly suggest their intended domain and purpose. Nodes with explicit call relationships (like `main` and `Calculator` methods) are grouped based on their direct interactions and shared responsibility for application flow and core logic. Nodes without explicit edges in this snippet (like `UserRepository` and `utils` functions) are clustered based on their inherent semantic meaning and common architectural patterns (e.g., data access layer, utility layer).
